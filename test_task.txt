***** Chat-Room ********
We maintain a decentralised application which includes chatting, storage and some kind of social media platform. Decentralised means (in this context), every user has his own (docker) container with his own files, a copy of each chat message send to each other and an instance of a node js application. When you send a message to another user in the UI, your container will communicate with the other persons container instead of a central database.

This is an advanced way for a chat application, therefore the knowledge of a 'normal' chat application is a good way to start. Below you'll find some requirements for a basic chat application.

Good luck and happy coding

*** TODO: ***
1. Build a single chat room with some kind of authentication
  - Frontend: VueJs => does not need to be styled
  - Backend: Nestjs => needs to be in memory and does not need to persist to a DB


*** USER Stories ***
1. As a User, I want to be able to create a User
 - Fill out a chat name
2. As a not logged-in User, I should not be able to see any messages
 - As a User, I want to be able to log in
3. It can be any kind of login (it should be decently secure)
 - As a logged-in user, I want to be able to log out
4. As a logged-in user, I want to be able to send messages in a chat room
 - The message should be a maximum of 255 characters
5. As a logged-in user, I want to receive and see messages in real-time.
